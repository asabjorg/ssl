PASS PHRASES FOR KEYS
====================
0000

ABOUT
=====
When a user starts the chat client the certificate and private
key get loaded and checked. The same thing happens when the
server gets started. 

PROTOCOL
========
Explain your protocol here.


Part 5. Passwords should be stored encrypted in a database on
the server side. 
Part 6. Private messages should NOT be stored anywhere because
we respect our user's privacy.
The consequences of this decision would be that no previous
private messages are ever reachable, however our user's
privacy will never be breached.


IMPLEMENTATION ERRORS
====================
-The /who command crashes the clients output,
any command run after that will have wrong output.
-The /user command changes the username at first but
afterwards for some reason it gets lost
